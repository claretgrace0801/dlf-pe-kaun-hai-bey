-Our app '@DLF' allows IIIT students to order food from the comfort of their hostels, which will be brought to them by the students who are currently at DLF.
-Users can place orders on the app, which the students at DLF are free to accept.

Need for the app:
-The solution to ordering food before this app was to text in a big group in Whatsapp "DLF pe koi hai kya?"
-This usually gets lost in the messages.
- '@DLF' makes sure this does not happen and ensures communication between the two parties.
